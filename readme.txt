= Developer Zone =
Yes, this plugin is developer friendly and supports **Custom Templates**. You can add templates via the theme or an add-on plugin. 
Create a new 'launcher' folder in your theme directory, and add your template files there. The new templates will automatically show up on the Settings page of the Launcher plugin. You can also copy templates from the 'templates' folder of the plugin into your 'launcher' theme folder, but keep in mind that if the file path is the same as that of a default template (e.g. default/default.php), then it will replace the default template instead of adding a new one.
